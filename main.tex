\section{Artificial gravity}

In science fiction, artificial gravity for space-craft and
space-stations is often generated via centripetal acceleration, see
\cite{2001,2010,missiontomars,themartian,expanse,babylon5,europareport,ringworld?,rama,intersetller,etc}
for an incomplete list. Usually characters live inside a cylinder that
is spinning, such as the von Braun Wheel depicted in figure
\ref{fig:Braun Wheel}.

Centripetal acceleration pushes them against the outside wall of the
cylinder. In television and film, (surely due to production
limitations) this ``artificial gravity'' is portrayed as being an
excellent facsimile for Earth's gravity. In this paper we seek to
answer the question of how accurately centripetal acceleration mimics
gravitational acceleration.

While centripetal acceleration (on cylindrical space-craft etc.) have
been extensively studied \cite{papers,anotherpaper}, all of these
studies focus on how gravity arises on these ships and/or how projectiles on 
a rotating ship behave through ``fictitious forces.''


In this paper, we seek to develop a tool-set to describe motion and space that an observer
 who lives inside a rotating ring would use. First we develop a coordinate system for a ring world. 
 Then we determine the various thresholds for projectile \textit{acrobatics} on a ring world. 


\subsection{Describing the position of projectiles on a ring world}

In this paper, we are modeling the motion of projectiles in a ring
world, as seen by the inhabitants of the ring world. These inhabitants
will view their world as being ``flat'' and hence, we will work in
$(x,y)$-coordinates.  The $y$-coordinate is the height above the
ground in the ring world.  The $x$-coordinate represents horizontal
position on the ring world, and the $y$-coordinate will be given by $R
- r$, where $R$ is the radius of the ring world and $r$ is the
distance from the center of the ship to an object measure along a
radius, see Figure~\ref{fig:vertical}.

Defending this choice of coordinates, we point to the fact that local
distances on the Earth are considered in exactly the same way. 


We can gain some intuition by considering relative distances
on earth, which is a sphere. On earth the point where front and back
get muddled are when we consider objects at the opposite end of the
planet. Intuitively though, an object that is closer in the forwards
direction \textit{in front.}  An object that is closer in the
backwards direction is \textit{behind.} \newline



We will define the 

While height is well defined, we still must settle on what is meant by
the $x$-coordinate of the ring world.  for instance, in figure
\ref{fig:what_is_x} has looped around the circumference and now lands
in front of the observer some arc length $x$.  Is the ball at $2\pi R
+ x$ or is it simply at $x$? Also what if the ball landed some
distance $x$ \textit{behind} the observer?  Would the ball be at at
$2\pi R - x$ or $-x$? \newline

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/define_horizontal_pos_rough.JPG}
	\caption{A ball can talk many paths only to end up right in front of you.}
	\label{fig:what_is_x}
\end{figure}


Extending this to the ring world case, anything that is closer to the observer in the backward direction is negative and and everything 
else is positive as shown in figure \ref{fig:neg_positive_horizontal}




\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/define_neg_pos_rough.JPG}
	\caption{Region in blue is negative, region in red is positive.}
	\label{fig:neg_positive_horizontal}
\end{figure}

This gives us our second theorem which is: 
\begin{theorem}
  For a 2-D ring world of radius $R$, the farthest an object may be from any other object is $\pi R$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Projectile Motion from Ring World Inhabitant Perspective}


When on a planet, we assume that the acceleration due to gravity is a
constant, call it $g$. Letting
$(x_{\mathrm{planet}},y_{\mathrm{planet}})$ denote the position
of a projectile thrown at an angle of $\theta$ from the horizontal, we
set
\begin{align*}
  x''_{\mathrm{planet}}(t) &= 0,\\
  y''_{\mathrm{planet}}(t) &= -g.
\end{align*}
Antidifferentiating, and letting $v_0$ be the magnitude of the initial
velocity of the projectile, we find
\begin{align*}
  x'_{\mathrm{planet}}(t) &= v_0 \cos(\theta),\\
  y'_{\mathrm{planet}}(t) &= -g t  + v_0 \sin(\theta).
\end{align*}
Antidifferentating once more, and letting $(x_0,y_0)$ be the
initial position of the projectile, we find
\begin{align*}
  x_{\mathrm{planet}}(t) &=  v_0 t \cos(\theta)  + x_0,\\
  y_{\mathrm{planet}}(t) &=  -g/2 t^2 + v_0 t \sin(\theta)  + y_0.
\end{align*}
These equations of projectile motion describe the path an object takes
after being thrown.

[[IMAGE]]

We seek analogous equations that show the path of a projectile on a
rotating space station. In particular, we wish to show the path from
the view-point of people on the station using the coordinate system $x,y$ of the previous
section. 
\newline
We imagine shooting a single feather arrow with on the ring world. We wish to track its orientation and coordinates along it's journey. We denote $\alpha$ as the 
angle between the arrow pole and the horizontal on the ship. We denote $\beta$ as the angle between the arrow feather and the vertical. 

[[IMAGE OF ARROW]]

We first jump straight into the orbital case for the arrow, in which we shoot the arrow
 from a height $h$ at a velocity $v_{orbit} = \omega \frac{R-h}{}$ where the arrow is 
 shot such that it opposes the rotation of the ring world. In the case for a counter clockwise ring world, we 
 shoot the arrow to the left so that $\alpha=0$ and $\beta = \pi$.

Immediately we find that the arrow hovers above the ground at constant $h$, but something else happens as well! The arrow also maintains a constant angle with respect to the horizontal.
What gives? 

From this perspective,
\textit{vertical} is defined as the distance from the floor of the
habitation ring and \textit{horizontal} is defined as the arc length
counter clockwise or clockwise from the observer.

	\label{fig:coord_ring}
\end{figure}




Thus the equations of motion for a projectile ((seems a bit quick!))
from the Ring World Inhabitant Perspective are:

\begin{align*}
  p_{r}(t) &= t^2 (v_x + \omega r_0 \cos(\omega t_0))^2 + (t(v_y + \omega
  r_0 \sin(\omega t_0) - R))^2\\
  p_{\theta R}(t) &=R \arctan(t(V_x + \omega r_0 \cos(\omega t_0)),tV_y +
                    t \omega r_0 \sin(\omega t_0))
\end{align*}

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{InertialArclengthProjectileLabeled.jpg}
  \label{fig:inertialview}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:shipview} depicts projectile motion (a ball thrown at
45 degrees) using the Ring World equations of motion above. Note that
figure \ref{fig:inertialview} depicts the same throw event in figure
\ref{fig:inertialview}, except from the outside inertial
perspective. Something interesting to note is that from the outside
perspective,the ball is not being thrown at a 45 degree angle with
respect to the thrower's horizontal axis (I wonder why that is).


Suppose an inhabitant of height $h$ decides to water their garden. The flowers are of arclength $R\Delta\Theta$ away. 

In order to find out, we will need to solve for the equations of
motion for free falling objects in Miller's frame. In particular we
will consider the case of a dropped ball. The most challenging aspect
of solving for the equations of motion in Miller's frame will be
determining the frame itself. As you'll see, defining up, down, left
and right on a spinning spaceship can be quite dizzying (pun
intended). We will approach the problem in two different ways. The
first method will take the viewpoint of an outside onlooker and use
rotation of frames to determine how the ball will fall from Miller's
perspective. In the second way, we will use the arclength of the ship
to describe the $x$ direction, while the distance from the ball to the
center of the ship, minus the ship radius itself describes the height
of the ball.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    r &= \lvert \vec{b} \rvert \\
    &= \sqrt{(x_0^2+y_0^2)(1+\omega^2 t^2)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


The arclength between Miller and the ball is:
\begin{equation}
 x = \gamma R
\end{equation}

Where $\gamma$ is the angle between Miller and the ball.

\[
\includegraphics[natwidth = 300]{arclengthLabeled.png}
\]

$\gamma$ can easily be found by using the dot product definition:
\[\vec{m}\cdot\vec{b}= \lvert \vec{m} \rvert \lvert \vec{b} \rvert cos(\gamma)\]

And taking the $\arccos$ so that $\gamma$ is:
\begin{equation}
\gamma  = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{m}\cdot \vec{b}}{\lvert \vec{m} \rvert \lvert \vec{b} \rvert}\right) 
 = \arccos\left (\frac{\vec{m}\cdot \vec{b}}{rR}\right)
\end{equation}

Thus the equation of motion for the ball that Miller sees is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:uV1}
    \vec{u}_{arc} = \langle R cos(\gamma), h \rangle
\end{equation}




\subsection*{Comparison to Real Gravity}

Now that we've derived the equations of motion that a ball would take
if dropped from the ship, we can compare their height as a function of
time to the height of a ball if dropped on a planet where gravity is
(approximately) constant. Our end goal is to determine what kind of
situations give realistic gravity from Miller's point of view. The $x$
components for each method are both non-zero as a function of time,
which does not line up (pun intended) with a ball dropped on
Earth. While this is important, we will not analyze the $x$ component
until the next section where we discuss projectile motion.

The height of a ball dropped on a planet with gravity $g$ with a starting height of $h_0$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    h(t)=\frac{1}{2}gt^2 +h_0
\end{equation}

Whereas the height of a ball from the ship as a function of time given the rotation of frames method $h_{rot}(t)$ and the arclength method $h_{arc}(t)$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    h_{rot}(t) = R+(\omega t x_0 + y_0)cos(\theta(t))+(\omega t y_0 - x_0)sin(\theta (t))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    h_{arc}(t) = R - \sqrt{(x_0^2+y_0^2)(1+\omega^2 t^2)} \\
\end{equation}

In order to compare $h_{arc}(t)$ and $h_{rot}(t)$ to $h(t)$, we need to find the ship's simulated gravity for the ship's given $\omega$ and $R$. Then we will do a Taylor series expansion of $h_{arc}(t)$ and $h_{rot}(t)$ and see how the expansion terms compare to $h(t)$. We should expect the quadratic terms of the expansion to be $\frac{1}{2}gt^2$.

We will consider the gravity of the ship: $g_{ship}$  to be the acceleration that Miller feels at his feet while standing stationary. This is can be found by taking the second derivative of Miller's position with respect to time:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     g_{ship}&=\lvert\vec{m}''(t)\rvert \\
     &= \frac{d^2}{dt^2}R\lvert \langle sin(\theta(t),-cos(\theta(t)\rangle \rvert \\
     &=R \omega^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

To simplify the expansion, we assume that  $\phi$ is zero and the ball starts at $\langle x_0,y_0\rangle$ from the center of the ship. Doing a Taylor series expansion on $h_{rot}(t)$ and $h_{arc}(t)$ (with \textsl{Mathematica}) yields:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     h_{rot}(t) &\approx (R+y_0)+\frac{1}{2}\omega^2 y_0 t^2 - \frac{1}{3}\omega^3 x_0 t^3 -\frac{1}{8}\omega^4 y_0 t^4... \\
     &\approx (r_0)+\frac{1}{2}\omega^2 y_0 t^2 - \frac{1}{3}\omega^3 x_0 t^3 -\frac{1}{8}\omega^4 y_0 t^4...
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 h_{arc}(t) \approx h_0 -\frac{1}{2}\omega^2 r_0 t^2 + \frac{1}{8}\omega^4 r_0 t^4 ...
\end{equation}

From the Taylor series expansion above, we can see that $h_{rot}(t)$
and $h_{arc}(t)$ are extremely similar (identical up to the 4th order
assuming $x_0$ is zero) since $g_{ship} = R \omega^2$ and $R+y_0 =
h_0$. This makes sense, as the rotation method and arclength method
only really begin to differ when $\theta(t)$ becomes large. However,
by the time $\theta(t)$ actually becomes large, the ball has long
since hit the grown of the ship. While both methods are fine
approaches to artificial gravity, we will exclusively use $h_{rot}(t)$
when comparing artificial gravity to planetary gravity. This is
because the rotation method is computationally simple (does not
require arcCosine) and comparing $h_{rot}(t)$ and $h_{arc}(t)$ along
side $h(t)$ is fruitless, as $h_{rot}(t)$ and $h_{arc}(t)$ will appear
identical when compared to the second order differences between
artificial and planetary gravity. From now on we will define
artificial gravity as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:approxGravHeight}
\begin{split}
    h(t)_{approx} &= h(t)_{rot} \\
    &=R+(\omega t x_0 + y_0)cos(\theta(t))+(\omega t y_0 - x_0)sin(\theta (t))
\end{split}
\end{equation}

From the Taylor series expansion We also find that $h_{approx}(t)$ is approximate to real gravity when $r_0 \approx R$! Assuming Miller drops objects (such as pouring water) from eye level, we can now investigate what is ``good" artificial gravity. In particular we want to investigate a `Just Noticeable Difference' for objects poured over a distance of 1 meter. According to Weber's law

Making the substitution  and $x_0 =0$ yields an identical 0th and 1st order terms to both $h_{rot}(t)$ and $h_{arc}(t)$. $h_{rot}(t)$ and $h_{arc}(t)$ differ at the 3rd order term for non-zero , but since $x_0$ is zero,  and a near identical 0th and first order term for  when $r_0 \approx R$! 


\subsection*{Method 1: Applied to Projectile motion}
Thus far we have assumed that all objects dropped in artificial
gravity are initially at rest. This works well to simply describe what
Miller sees when pouring a drink in artificial gravity. However we can
explore a rich set of scenarios and situations by deriving the
equations of motion for a drink poured with \textit{initial
  velocity}. In this section we will derive the general equations of
motion for a projectile as seen in Miller's frame using the method of
rotating frames. We will no longer consider the arc length method
because the method requires the use of the arcCosine function (which
is unnecessarily complex).


Miller's position on the ship is still given by equation
\ref{eq:MillerPosition} on page \pageref{eq:MillerPosition}:

\[\vec{m} = R\langle sin(\theta (t) ), - cos (\theta (t) ) \rangle\]

The only change in derivation will be to add an initial velocity term,
$\vec{v}_{init}$ to the position function for the ball in equation
\ref{eq:BallV1} so that way the ball now has the position function:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:BallProjectile}
\begin{split}
     \vec{b}_{projectile} &= \langle x_0 - y_0 \omega t, y_0 + x_0 \omega t \rangle + \vec{v}_{init}t \\ 
     &\textnormal{where } \vec{v}_{init} = \langle v_{y0},v_{x0} \rangle
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Much of the same machinery used in the initial derivation in Method 1
can be used when considering projectile motion. Now it is just a
matter of substituting $\vec{b}$ with $\vec{b}_{projectile}$. Equation
\ref{eq:uV1} on page \pageref{eq:uV1} can now be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{p} = \vec{v}_{projectile} - \vec{m}
\end{equation}

Where $\vec{p}$ is the vector going from Miller to the projectile ball
as seen from the onlooker outside the spaceship. Finally we apply a
rotation matrix $Rot(-\theta(t))$ to $\vec{p}$ to obtain the path of
the projectile ball as seen in Miller's frame.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ProjectileMillerFrame}
\begin{split}
    \vec{p}_m &= Rot(-\theta(t))\vec{p} \\
    &= \langle (x_0 + t(v_{x0} - \omega y_0)) cos(\theta(t)) + (y_0 +t(v_{y0} + \omega x_0) sin(\theta(t)),\\
    & cos(\theta(t)) (R cos(\theta(t)) + y_0 + t(v_{y0} + \omega x_0)) \\
    &+ sin(\theta(t))(R sin(\theta(t)) + t(\omega y_0 - v_{x0})-x_0) \rangle
\end{split}
\end{equation}

There is one subtlety that we must hit on before continuing. When
dealing with projectile motion, the ball can have tangential
velocity. Initially we defined tangential velocity to generally be
$\omega r$, which was then used to define gravity as $g = \omega^2 r$.
However with the addition of some tangential velocity $v_{tang}$ the
gravity for an object on the space ship with a given position and
velocity is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TangentGravity}
\begin{split}
    g_{tang} = \frac{(\omega R + v_tang)^2}{R}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\hrulefill %This is just to know where your work ends and my prior work begins

Is depiction accurate? To approximate the path the drink will take
from the perspective of Miller, we first have to see how Ceres, and
therefore Miller, is moving. Afterwards, we can find the path of the
drink, and then subtract its position function from Miller's position
function to find the drink's path in his point of view. Miller's
position function can be modeled by the parametric equation of a
circle, \vec{p}, with a radius of $R$ and angular velocity $\omega$.

\[
\vec{p}(t) = \langle R\cos(\omega t),R \sin(\omega t)\rangle
\]

%Ceres' angular velocity can be found using the centripetal acceleration equation, $a = v^2 /r$, and when solved for velocity $v$, is $v = \sqrt{aR}$. From this, we find angular velocity $\omega = v/R = \sqrt{aR}/R$, meaning that on the Ceres, for its artificial gravity $a$ created within it, and its radius $R$, it will have an angular velocity of $\sqrt{aR}/R$, and will complete a full rotation in $\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{aR}/R}$ seconds.%

To find $\omega$, we will need to take the second derivative of $\vec{p}(t)$, $\vec{p}''(t)$, which will describe Miller's centripetal acceleration.

\[
\vec{p}''(t) = \langle -\omega^2 R \cos(\omega t), - \omega^2 R \sin(\omega t)\rangle
\]

We can then find the magnitude of the acceleration with respect to $\omega$ using the Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Using the $x$ and $y$ values of $\vec{p}''(t)$ as well as the fact that the acceleration is $0.3g$, we have

\begin{align*}
    a^2 &= x^2 + y^2 \\
    a &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{(-\omega^2 R cos(\omega t))^2 + (- \omega^2 R sin(\omega t))^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{\omega^4 R^2 (\sin^2(\omega t) + \cos^2(\omega t))} \\
    &= \sqrt{\omega^4 R^2} \\
    &= \omega^2 R
    \end{align*}
    So we may write
\begin{align*}
    \omega^2 &= a / R\\
    \omega &= \sqrt{a/R}
\end{align*}

Now that we know that $\omega = \sqrt{a/R}$, we can use our knowledge
that Ceres will complete one complete rotation in
$\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ seconds and the fact that linear velocity $v$ is
related to $\omega$ through $v = \omega R$ to find the position
function of the drink.

The drink will be poured a certain distance from the outside of Ceres,
so it will have a smaller radius, \(r\). Since this drink is no longer
influenced by Ceres' angular velocity after being poured, it will
travel tangentially from Ceres' surface at a linear velocity of \(v =
\omega r\). Using this information, and assuming the drink is poured
at $t = 0$, we have the position function of the drink, $\vec{b}(t)$,
as

\[
\vec{b}(t) = \langle r, \sqrt{\frac{a}{R}}rt\rangle
\]

Bringing it together, to find the path the drink takes from the
perspective of the person, we have to take the position function of
the drink, \vec{b}, and subtract it by the position function of the
person, \vec{p}, to get the net distance, \vec{d}(t).

\[
\vec{d}(t) = \vec{b}(t) - \vec{p}(t) = \langle r - R\cos(\sqrt{\frac{a}{R}} t), \sqrt{\frac{a}{R}}rt - R \sin(\sqrt{\frac{a}{R}} t)\rangle
\]

$\vec{n}(t)$ will track the path of the drink until it crosses the
y-axis, at which point it would be equivalent to hitting the floor of
Ceres. Plugging in the actual values of Ceres, and estimating the
drink to be poured $0.25$m above the cup, we have

\[
\vec{d}(t) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(473000 - 0.25) - 473000\cos(\sqrt{\frac{0.3\cdot9.8}{473000}}t)\\ \sqrt{\frac{0.3\cdot9.8}{473000}}(473000 - 0.25)t - 473000 \sin(\sqrt{\frac{0.3\cdot9.8}{473000}}t)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Finding when the x-component of $\vec{d}(t) = 0$, we find that $t =
\frac{\cos^{-1}(r/R)}{\omega} = 0.41239$ seconds, in the case given
above. solving for the y-component at $t=0.41239$, we find $y = -1.713
\cdot 10^{-4}$, meaning that casually pouring a drink would only shift
the stream less than a fifth of a millimeter from a similar pour on
Earth, following a path that resembles the beginning of a cycloid.

These effects can be magnified at greater distances. For example, if
something dropped from 10 meters, it would land about 4 centimeters
off from its Earth landing position, and from 100 meters, it would be
about 1.4 meters off. Whatever the case, the path of any falling
object, be it a drink or Miller's hat, does not resemble the path made
in The Expanse.

\section{Explosions}

In Episode 1, the \textit{Canterbury} is destroyed. 
The \textit{Knight} is then damaged by the wreckage. 
Is this realistic?

The wreckage can be modeled with the vector field:
\[
\vec{F}(x,y,z) = \frac{\vec{x}}{4\pi|\vec{x}|^3}
\]
where $\vec{x} = \langle x,y,z\rangle$

I believe the \textit{Canterbury} is $26000$ from the \textit{Knight}

Based on:

\texttt{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX8TlGCsllM}

It looks like the \textit{Canterbury} is $1000$m long and $250$ m wide.

\section{Cererian Gravity}

Ceres, a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, has been spun up by Tycho Manufacturing to have a gravitational force of $0.3$g. How fast would Ceres need to spin?

For any large rotating body, its gravity pulls objects toward its center, while the rotation of it counteracts gravity, pushing objects away. If the centrifugal force of the object is greater than its gravity, objects on the surface, and the surface itself, would fly off, tangent to the surface of the planet. To verify whether Ceres can maintain an internal artificial gravity of 0.3g, we can see if Cererian gravity is greater than the artificial gravity or note (Side note: If the artificial gravity was equal to the real gravity, anything on its surface would be weightless, as all of gravity is canceled out by the centrifugal force). Cererian gravity can be found though the Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation,
\[
g=\frac{GM}{R^2}
\]
where \(G=6.67*10^{-11}\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the object, and \(R\) is the radius of the object. For Ceres, \(M=9.4*10^{20}\) and \(R=4.73*10^5\), so
\[
g_{Ceres}=\frac{6.67*10^{-11}\cdot 9.4\cdot 10^{20}}{(4.73\cdot10^5)^2}=0.28\frac{m}{s^2}
\]

Since the gravitation of Ceres, $0.28 \frac{m}{s^2}$, is smaller than the centrifugal force, $0.3g$, Ceres wouldn't be able to withstand being spun up to 0.3g without losing a large part of its mass.

Knowing that $a_{centrifugal} = g$ to maintain a stable artificial gravity, many more questions arise. Is there a better candidate to spin up to achieve 0.3g? How big would Ceres look with missing mass, and how strong would the artificial gravity be? We'll take these questions one at a time.

\subsection{A Better Candidate}
In order to spin a planet so its artificial gravity is 0.3g, we need a planet that has a regular gravity over or equal to 0.3g. The closest match? Mars, with \(g_{Mars} = 0.376g\), but with the MCR already claiming the planet, the next best match is Mercury, with a very similar gravity of 0.37g.

\subsection{Ceres-ly Smaller}
Suppose Tycho followed through with spinning up Ceres to the speed necessary for 0.3g, even though it would shed a significant amount of mass. How big would this new Ceres look, and what would the artificial gravity be like inside of it?

First, we need to find the velocity of Ceres at its equator, and by manipulating \(a = \frac{v^2}{R}\), we get \(v = \sqrt{aR}= \sqrt{0.3g * 4.73 * 10^5} = 1179\frac{m}{s}\). We also know that \(\omega = \frac{v}{R} = \frac{1179}{4.73*10^5} = 0.00249\frac{rad}{s}\). Using \(v=\omega  r\) and \(a_{centripetal} = g = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2}\), we now have 
\[
\frac{(\omega r)^2}{r} = \frac{G M}{r^2}\quad
\Leftrightarrow \quad r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{GM}{\omega}},
\]
giving us the radius of the new Ceres, which is 
\[
\sqrt[3]{
\frac{6.67*10^{-11}*9.4*10^{20}}{0.00249^2}
} = 29316m.
\]
For perspective, that's similar to something the size of a car tire disintegrating into something the size of a quarter.

Next, we need to find the mass of the smaller Ceres. We'll assume that Ceres is round and has uniform density. Given that density \(\rho = \frac{M_{old}}{V_{old}}\), where \(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) is the volume of a sphere, we can find the new mass as 
\begin{align*}
    M_{new} &= \rho V_{new}\\
    &= \frac{M_{old}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{old}^3}\cdot \frac{4\pi r_{new}^3}{3} \\
    &= \frac{M_{old}r_{new}^3}{r_{old}^3} \\
    &= \frac{9.4\cdot10^{20} \cdot 29316^3}{(4.73\cdot 10^5)^3} \\
    &= 2.24\cdot10^{17}kg.
\end{align*}

Finally, to find the maximum artificial gravity of the smaller Ceres, we just need to find the surface gravity of it, which would be \(\frac{GM_{new}}{r_{new}^2}=\frac{6.67*10^{-11}*2.24*10^{17}}{(29316)^2} = 0.017\frac{m}{s^2} = 0.0018g\), falling short of the 0.3g goal by quite a large amount.
